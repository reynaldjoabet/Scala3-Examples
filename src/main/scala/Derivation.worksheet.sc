// PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2), used to derive cryptographic keys from passwords
//A key derivation function is a function that derives one or more secret values (the keys) from one secret value.

/* Key derivation functions can be useful, for example, when a cryptographic protocol starts with a single secret value, such as a shared password or a secret derived using Diffie-Hellman key exchange, but requires multiple secret values to operate, such as encryption and MAC keys. Another use case of key derivation functions is in cryptographically secure random number generators */

//HKDF is based on HMAC
